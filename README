Adconnect is a bare-bones gem for authenticating to an Active Directory server.

Example:

require 'adconnect'

Adconnect::ActiveDirectoryUser.server = "localhost"
Adconnect::ActiveDirectoryUser.port = "329"
Adconnect::ActiveDirectoryUser.base = "DC=example,DC=com"
Adconnect::ActiveDirectoryUser.domain = "example.com"

user = Adconnect::ActiveDirectoryUser.authenticate('myusername','mypassword')

user.cn
=> ["firstname lastname"]
